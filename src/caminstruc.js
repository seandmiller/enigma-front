        <p>This part of the Application works on the same concept from earlier, The only difference is instead of typing the word in it will work primarly on visual data </p>
         <p>Simply take a photo of the text you want to encrypt or decrypt and it will appear on your screen! Make sure you take a good photo! Do not photograph any text you don't want to encrypt/decrypt
